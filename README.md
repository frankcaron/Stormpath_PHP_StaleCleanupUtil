Stormpath Disabled User Clean-up Utility
=================

This is a simple PHP utility which will return a report of disabled
users in a specified Stormpath application and provide a control to bulk enable them. 

This is an example of using the Stormpath PHP SDK for the purposes of manipulating
a cloud-based, federated user store enabled by Stormpath's solution.
