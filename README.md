Stormpath Stale Clean-up Utility
=================

This is a simple PHP utility which will return a report of stale
users in a specified Stormpath application. The report details
all the users who have not logged in to a particular application, across
directories, in the last 30 days.

It is an example of using the Stormpath REST APIs for managing 
your cloud federated user auth store.
